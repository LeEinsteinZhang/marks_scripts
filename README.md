# University of Waterloo Course Account Marks Scripts

This project includes two scripts: `marm2` and `edx`, which are designed for downloading and managing grades and submissions for academic courses.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the required permissions and environment to run these scripts (e.g., bash environment, necessary packages).
- Ensure the `~/bin` directory exists on your system, or create it.

### Setup Steps

1. Clone or download this project to your course account.

2. Run the `setup.sh` script to set up your environment. This script will link the `marm2` and `edx` scripts to the `~/bin` directory, making them executable from this scripts.

    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

3. Follow the prompts. If `~/bin/edx` or `~/bin/marm2` already exists, `setup.sh` will ask if you want to replace them. If you choose not to replace, it will also offer the option to rename these links.

4. Call `edx` module with flag `-i` to initialize the edx repo.
